# Quick tutorial on how to mod older versions of Fortnite.

## 1. Download the UE4 build that the Fortnite version you want to mod uses. 

- (For Season 4 i recommend using 4.19 as custom maps work on it, and for season 7, 4.21.)

## 2. After you download Unreal Engine, open it and create a new blank project called "FortniteGame".

## 3. After you've done that, make a folder and call it "Maps", then create a level inside of it and choose a name for it.

## 4. Then create 2 c++ classes, one that's an Actor, call it "FortTimeOfDayManager", and second one thats a child of WorldSettings, call it "FortWorldSettings".
- You need either Visual Studio 2017 or 2019, depends on the UE4 build that you are using!
